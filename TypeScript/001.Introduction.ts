// What is TypeScript ?
//-> TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript introduces static typing, interfaces, and other features to help developers catch errors early and write more maintainable code. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, which can run in any environment that supports JavaScript.

// What's wrong with JavaScript ?
//-> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that types are checked at runtime. This can lead to runtime errors that are hard to debug. Additionally, JavaScript lacks features like interfaces and strong typing, which can make it difficult to manage large codebases. TypeScript addresses these issues by providing static typing, interfaces, and other features that help developers write more robust code.

// Benefits of TypeScript
//-> TypeScript offers several benefits over JavaScript, including:
//1. Static Typing: TypeScript allows developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime.
//2. Interfaces: TypeScript supports interfaces, which allow developers to define contracts for objects. This helps ensure that objects adhere to a specific structure, making code more predictable and easier to maintain.
//3. Enhanced Tooling: TypeScript provides better tooling support, including autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring tools. This can improve developer productivity and reduce the likelihood of errors.
//4. Improved Readability: TypeScript's static typing and interfaces can make code more readable and self-documenting, making it easier for developers to understand the codebase.
